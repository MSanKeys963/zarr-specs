Abstract
========

This specification defines an implementation of the Zarr abstract
store API using a file system.


Status of this document
=======================

.. warning::
    This document is a draft for review and subject to changes.
    It will become final when the `Zarr Enhancement Proposal (ZEP) 1 <https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0001.html>`_
    is approved via the `ZEP process <https://zarr.dev/zeps/active/ZEP0000.html>`_.


Document conventions
====================

Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
descriptive assertions and [RFC2119]_ terminology. The key words
"MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative
parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC2119]_. However, for readability, these words do not appear in all
uppercase letters in this specification.

All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. Examples in
this specification are introduced with the words "for example".


Configuration parameters
========================

cname:
    A string identifying the internal compression algorithm to be
    used. At the time of writing, the following values are supported
    by the c-blosc library: "lz4", "lz4hc", "blosclz", "zstd",
    "snappy", "zlib".
    
clevel:
    An integer from 0 to 9 which controls the speed and level of
    compression. A level of 1 is the fastest compression method and
    produces the least compressions, while 9 is slowest and produces
    the most compression. Compression is turned off completely when
    level is 0.

shuffle:
    An integer value in the set {0, 1, 2, -1} indicating the way
    bytes or bits are rearranged, which can lead to faster
    and/or greater compression. A value of 1
    indicates that byte-wise shuffling is performed prior to
    compression. A value of 2 indicates the bit-wise shuffling is
    performed prior to compression. If a value of -1 is given,
    then default shuffling is used: bit-wise shuffling for buffers
    with item size of 1 byte, byte-wise shuffling otherwise.
    Shuffling is turned off completely when the value is 0.

blocksize:
    An integer giving the size in bytes of blocks into which a
    buffer is divided before compression. A value of 0
    indicates that an automatic size will be used.

For example, the array metadata document below specifies that the
compressor is the Blosc codec configured with a compression level of
1, byte-wise shuffling, the ``lz4`` compression algorithm and the
default block size::

    {
        "codecs": [{
            "type": "blosc",
            "configuration": {
                "cname": "lz4",
                "clevel": 1,
                "shuffle": 1,
                "blocksize": 0
            }
        }],
    }


Format and algorithm
====================

Blosc is a meta-compressor, which divides an input buffer into blocks,
then applies an internal compression algorithm to each block, then
packs the encoded blocks together into a single output buffer with a
header. The format of the encoded buffer is defined in [BLOSC]_. The
reference implementation is provided by the `c-blosc library
<https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc>`_.
